# Shared block: surface relevant directives

Lowercase the focus brief and scan it for substring matches against the loaded directive filenames (both plugin defaults at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/directives/*.md` and the user's directives at `<project-root>/<directives.user_path>/*.md` if present). Strip the `.md` extension before matching, but match against the *full base name* — so `"scope"` matches `scope-discipline.md`, `"simplicity"` matches `simplicity.md`, and `"copy-paste"` would match a user directive named `copy-paste.md` if present (it doesn't match the shipped `reusability.md` — the matcher is a literal substring check, not a synonym mapper).

Record the matched directive paths. They will be flagged as **primary** in agent dispatch prompts under the heading "Directives most relevant to this run" so agents weight them first.

If the focus brief is empty, no directives are flagged primary; all directives still load normally.
